Exercise: 
1. Change your mini-capstone so there can be multiple images, instead of just one. (This will take multiple steps!) 

rails generate migration RemoveImageUrlFromProducts image_url:string


You will need to remove the image_url attribute from the Product model and create an entirely new Image model to do this. 
Use url as the image attribute to get this to work seamlessly with the mini-capstone front end.

Need an images table
     Populate with image_urls


Associate with Products
Assign product_id


Image 

belongs_to :product

Product

has_many :images



2. Change your json serializer to show all images with each product.


You can test your code using the frontend at http://mini-capstone.peterxjang.com/model-associations/products. If your associations are working correctly, it will show multiple images on the products show page in a carousel!
3. Bonus: Fix your product’s create and update actions! (They are broken because you changed how images are saved…)
4. Bonus: Make it so a user can create new images for a given product.
